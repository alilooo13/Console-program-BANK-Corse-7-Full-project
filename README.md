🏦 Client Management & Banking System (C++ Console Application)

A menu-driven Client Management and Banking System built in C++, designed to simulate real-world banking operations such as managing client records, handling deposits and withdrawals, and persisting data using files.

This project focuses on data management, file handling, structured programming, and user-driven workflows, making it a strong beginner-to-intermediate level C++ portfolio project.

📌 Project Overview

The application allows the user to:

Manage client records (Add, Update, Delete, Find)

Store client data persistently using text files

Perform banking transactions (Deposit, Withdraw)

Display individual and total client balances

Navigate through structured menus

Validate user input and prevent invalid operations

The program mimics a basic banking system, emphasizing correctness, data consistency, and clean program flow.

🧠 Concepts & Skills Practiced

This project integrates many essential C++ concepts into one cohesive application:

🗂️ Data Structures & Organization

struct to store client details (account number, PIN, name, balance, etc.)

vector for dynamic storage and manipulation of client records

Boolean flags to mark records for deletion

📁 File Handling

Reading client data from a file at startup

Writing updated data back to the file

Converting structured data to/from text format

Persistent storage using fstream

🧩 Program Logic & Design

Menu-driven application design

Enums for clean and readable menu options

Modular function-based architecture

Separation of concerns (I/O, logic, data handling)

🔁 Control Flow

Loops for menu navigation and validation

switch-case for menu selection

Conditional logic for validation and confirmation prompts

🧮 Banking & Transaction Logic

Deposit and withdrawal operations

Balance validation to prevent overdrafts

Real-time balance updates

Calculation of total balances across all clients

🖥️ Console Interaction

Formatted output using iomanip

Screen clearing using system("cls")

Console color feedback using system("color")

Pause and navigation between menus
